### How Nim Works

<br>

- *Nim* is a two-player game in which players take turns picking up sticks. The game begins with various numbers of sticks in a number of piles. On any turn, a player must choose a pile and remove one or more sticks from that pile (up to the number of sticks in the pile). The object of the game is to force your opponent to pick up the last stick in the last pile. 



## Objective
---
<br>

- Write a program that allows two people to playa game of Nim. The program should start by creating four piles of sticks, each with a number of sticks that varies randomly from four to eight and displaying the piles on the screen. The program should then prompt the first player to remove a number of sticks from a pile. Once that player has provided valid input, the program should then adjust the piles and display the new configuration. This process should continue until one player has won the game, at which time the computer should print a congratulatory note to the winner. At the end of each game, the computer should start a new game if the users state that they want to do so. Once the users state that they are done, the computer should print the number of games won by each player.
